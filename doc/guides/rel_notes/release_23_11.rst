     =======================================================

* **Build requirements increased for C11.**

  From DPDK 23.11 onwards,
  building DPDK will require a C compiler which supports the C11 standard,
  including support for C11 standard atomics.

  More specifically, the requirements will be:

  * Support for flag "-std=c11" (or similar)
  * __STDC_NO_ATOMICS__ is *not defined* when using c11 flag

  Please note:

  * C11, including standard atomics, is supported from GCC version 5 onwards,
    and is the default language version in that release
    (Ref: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html)
  * C11 is the default compilation mode in Clang from version 3.6,
    which also added support for standard atomics
    (Ref: https://releases.llvm.org/3.6.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)

* **Added new build options.**

  * Enabling deprecated libraries is now done using
    the new ``enable_deprecated_libraries`` build option.
  * Optional libraries can now be selected with the new ``enable_libs``
    build option similarly to the existing ``enable_drivers`` build option.

* **Introduced a new API for atomic operations.**

  This new API serves as a wrapper for transitioning
  to standard atomic operations as described in the C11 standard.
  This API implementation points at the compiler intrinsics by default.
  The implementation using C11 standard atomic operations is enabled
  via the ``enable_stdatomic`` build option.

* **Added support for power intrinsics with AMD processors.**

* **Added mbuf recycling support.**

  Added ``rte_eth_recycle_rx_queue_info_get`` and ``rte_eth_recycle_mbufs``
  functions which allow the user to copy used mbufs from the Tx mbuf ring
  into the Rx mbuf ring. This feature supports the case that the Rx Ethernet
  device is different from the Tx Ethernet device with respective driver
  callback functions in ``rte_eth_recycle_mbufs``.

* **Added amd-pstate driver support to the power management library.**

  Added support for amd-pstate driver which works on AMD EPYC processors.

* **Added a flow action type for P4-defined actions.**

  For P4-programmable devices, hardware pipeline can be configured through
  a new "PROG" action type and its associated custom arguments.
  Such P4 pipeline, not using the standard blocks of the flow API,
  can be managed with ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_FLEX`` and ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_PROG``.

* **Added flow group set miss actions.**

  Introduced ``rte_flow_group_set_miss_actions()`` API to explicitly set
  a group's miss actions, which are the actions to be performed on packets
  that didn't match any of the flow rules in the group.

* **Updated Solarflare net driver.**

  * Added support for transfer flow action ``INDIRECT`` with subtype ``VXLAN_ENCAP``.
  * Supported packet replay (multi-count / multi-delivery) in transfer flows.

* **Updated Netronome/Corigine nfp driver.**

  * Added inline IPsec offload based on the security framework.

* **Updated Wangxun ngbe driver.**

  * Added 100M and auto-neg support in YT PHY fiber mode.

* **Added support for TLS and DTLS record processing.**

  Added TLS and DTLS record transform for security session
  and added enhancements to ``rte_crypto_op`` fields
  to handle all datapath requirements of TLS and DTLS.
  The support was added for TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.2.

* **Added out of place processing support for inline ingress security session.**

  Similar to out of place processing support for lookaside security session,
  added the same support for inline ingress security session.

* **Added security Rx inject API.**

  Added Rx inject API to allow applications to submit packets
  for protocol offload and have them injected back to ethdev Rx
  so that further ethdev Rx actions (IP reassembly, packet parsing and flow lookups)
  can happen based on inner packet.

  The API when implemented by an ethdev, application would be able to process
  packets that are received without/failed inline offload processing
  (such as fragmented ESP packets with inline IPsec offload).
  The API when implemented by a cryptodev, can be used for injecting packets
  to ethdev Rx after IPsec processing and take advantage of ethdev Rx actions
  for the inner packet which cannot be accelerated in inline protocol offload mode.

* **Updated cryptodev scheduler driver.**

  * Added support for DOCSIS security protocol
    through the ``rte_security`` API callbacks.

* **Updated ipsec_mb crypto driver.**

  * Added support for digest encrypted to AESNI_MB asynchronous crypto driver.

* **Updated Intel QuickAssist Technology driver.**

  * Enabled support for QAT 2.0c (4944) devices in QAT crypto driver.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk crypto driver.**

  * Added SM2 algorithm support in asymmetric crypto operations.

* **Added new eventdev Ethernet Rx adapter create API.**

  Added new function ``rte_event_eth_rx_adapter_create_ext_with_params()``
  for creating Rx adapter instance for the applications desire to
  control both the event port allocation and event buffer size.

* **Added event DMA adapter library.**

  * Added the Event DMA Adapter Library. This library extends the event-based
    model by introducing APIs that allow applications to enqueue/dequeue DMA
    operations to/from dmadev as events scheduled by an event device.

* **Added eventdev support to link queues to port with link profile.**

  Introduced event link profiles that can be used to associated links between
  event queues and an event port with a unique identifier termed as link profile.
  The profile can be used to switch between the associated links in fast-path
  without the additional overhead of linking/unlinking and waiting for unlinking.

  * Added ``rte_event_port_profile_links_set``, ``rte_event_port_profile_unlink``
    ``rte_event_port_profile_links_get`` and ``rte_event_port_profile_switch``
    functions to enable this feature.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk eventdev driver.**

  * Added support for ``remaining_ticks_get`` timer adapter PMD callback
    to get the remaining ticks to expire for a given event timer.

  ``struct rte_eth_bond_8023ad_slave_info`` was renamed to
  ``struct rte_eth_bond_8023ad_member_info`` in DPDK 23.11.
  The following functions were removed in DPDK 23.11.
