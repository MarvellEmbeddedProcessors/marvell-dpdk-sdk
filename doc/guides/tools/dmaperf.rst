dpdk-test-dma-perf Application
==============================

The ``dpdk-test-dma-perf`` tool is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) application that enables
testing the performance of DMA (Direct Memory Access) devices available within DPDK. It provides a
test framework to assess the performance of CPU and DMA devices under various scenarios, such as
varying buffer lengths. Doing so provides insight into the potential performance when using these
DMA devices for acceleration in DPDK applications. It supports memory copy performance tests for
now, comparing the performance of CPU and DMA automatically in various conditions with the help of a
pre-set configuration file.


Configuration
-------------
This application uses inherent DPDK EAL command-line options as well as custom command-line options
in the application. An example configuration file for the application is provided and gives the
meanings for each parameter.

Here is an extracted sample from the configuration file (the complete sample can be found in the
application source directory):

.. code-block:: ini

   [case1]
   type=DMA_MEM_COPY
   mem_size=10
   buf_size=64,8192,2,MUL
   dma_ring_size=1024
   kick_batch=32
   src_numa_node=0
   dst_numa_node=0
   cache_flush=0
   test_seconds=2
   lcore_dma=lcore10@0000:00:04.2, lcore11@0000:00:04.3
   eal_args=--in-memory --file-prefix=test

   [case2]
   type=CPU_MEM_COPY
   mem_size=10
   buf_size=64,8192,2,MUL
   src_numa_node=0
   dst_numa_node=1
   cache_flush=0
   test_seconds=2
   lcore = 3, 4
   eal_args=--in-memory --no-pci

The configuration file is divided into multiple sections, each section represents a test case.
The four variables mem_size, buf_size, dma_ring_size, and kick_batch can vary in each test case.
The format for this is ``variable=first,last,increment,ADD|MUL``. This means that the first value
of the variable is 'first', the last value is 'last', 'increment' is the step size, and ADD|MUL
indicates whether the change is by addition or multiplication. Each case can only have one variable
change, and each change will generate a scenario, so each case can have multiple scenarios.

Parameter Definitions
---------------------

- **type**: The type of the test. Currently supported types are `DMA_MEM_COPY` and `CPU_MEM_COPY`.
- **mem_size**: The size of the memory footprint.
- **buf_size**: The memory size of a single operation.
- **dma_ring_size**: The DMA ring buffer size. Must be a power of two, and between 64 and 4096.
- **kick_batch**: The DMA operation batch size, should be greater than 1 normally.
- **src_numa_node**: Controls the NUMA node where the source memory is allocated.
- **dst_numa_node**: Controls the NUMA node where the destination memory is allocated.
- **cache_flush**: Determines whether the cache should be flushed. `1` indicates to flush and `0` to not flush.
- **test_seconds**: Controls the test time for each scenario.
- **lcore_dma**: Specifies the lcore/DMA mapping.
- **lcore**: Specifies the lcore for CPU testing.
- **eal_args**: Specifies the EAL arguments.

.. Note::

	The mapping of lcore to DMA must be one-to-one and cannot be duplicated.

To specify a configuration file, use the "\-\-config" flag followed by the path to the file.

To specify a result file, use the "\-\-result" flag followed by the path to the file. If you do not
specify a result file, one will be generated with the same name as the configuration file, with the
addition of "_result.csv" at the end.


Running the Application
-----------------------

Typical command-line invocation to execute the application:

.. code-block:: console

   dpdk-test-dma-perf --config=./config_dma.ini --result=./res_dma.csv

Where `config_dma.ini` is the configuration file, and `res_dma.csv` will be the generated result
file.

After the tests, you can find the results in the `res_dma.csv` file.

Limitations
-----------

Currently, this tool only supports memory copy performance tests. Additional enhancements are
possible in the future to support more types of tests for DMA devices and CPUs.
