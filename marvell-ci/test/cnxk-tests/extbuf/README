========
OVERVIEW
========
This directory contains the test application for testing the external
buffer feature.

The external buffer implementation is deviating from the spec in terms
of free callback handling. The mbuf to which the external buffer is
attached to will immediately get freed in the Tx routine before the
Tx is completed. So user should *ALWAYS* pass a dummy free callback
while initializing the external buffer to make sure that the buffer
is not freed prematurely.

The actual freeing of the external buffers should be handled separately
by the user in the application.


================
TEST APPLICATION
================
The test application demonstrates the Tx of a 5-segmented packet where each
segment is as follows.

 * Segment 1 - Mbuf allocated each time in the transmit routine.
 * Segment 2 - Mbuf attached to user buffer at offset 0. This is allocated
               only once.
 * Segment 3 - Normal mbuf which is allocated only once.
 * Segment 4 - Mbuf attached to user buffer at offset 64. This is allocated
               only once.
 * Segment 5 - Mbuf attached to an external buffer where the external buffer
               is a chunk of memory from segment 1.

The start of each of these segments are marked with a magic pattern. The
application also runs in an Rx mode where it checks whether the received
buffers are valid by verifying the magic patterns.


==========
HOW TO RUN
==========

Simply launching the application with no arguments will start Tx in all
available ports.

 ./dpdk-extbuf


Users can also give the usual EAL arguments to restrict
the number of ports and lcores where the application runs on.

 ./dpdk-extbuf -c 0x5 -a 0002:01:00.1


To limit the number of packets being sent, run as follows.

 ./dpdk-extbuf -c 0x5 -a 0002:01:00.1 -- --max-tx 1000


To run in Rx mode, run as follows.
 ./dpdk-extbuf -c 0x5 -a 0002:01:00.1 -- --rx

Note: Rx mode touches each packet and verifies the magic pattern in the
      packets. So packet drops will be seen as Rx will not be able to keep
      up with Tx.
